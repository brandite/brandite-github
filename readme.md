#### Key concepts
* Repository: All the files, history, modifications, etc. of a single project. Stored either in a folder on your computer or as a unit on Github. Most importantly, it contains all the Commits (or commit objects). Also known as a repo.
* Commit: Used as a noun. A set of files corresponding to the state of the project, all it's files, at a certain point in time. Analogous to a zip or archive of a directory. All commits (except the first one) have a (or more) parent(s), from which they came.

#### Small demo
* Create a simple repo
`mkdir [project]`
`cd [project]`
